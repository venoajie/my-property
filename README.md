# MyApp
#### Provide non-hft trading platform that allowed multiple strategy in the same instrument. Could improve the capital efficiency and risk management.

#### Supported exchanges: Deribit. Others coming soon

#### WIP. Tested in Python 3.8 and Ubuntu 20.04 environment

## Current feature list:
- [x] Automatic **hedging** for equity balances in crypto spot
- [x] Grid trading (continously send orders to market based on position/time)
- [x] Back up database to cloud and local
- [x] Send automatic order based on pre-defined manual target


## Transaction types:
- Hedging.
- Trading, based on:
    Grid (continously send short and long. Net size expected to be zero)
    Price action/TA (send order based on market condition and provided with )
- Balancing


## Transaction flow:

- Fetch both market and exchange data through websocket and temporary save them either sqlite3 or in pickle format.
- Modify market data for further analysis
- Check the balance in crypto currency. Check whether they have properly hedged
- Determine parameters for risk management at configuration files (especially, max risk per transaction as the basis for position sizing)
- Frequently check market condition and current asset position. Send/cancel order based on them
- Frequently: check current position based on time (every x seconds using sleep function as well as scheduler) and events (by captured any changes taken place at balance/position using rsync)
- Send transaction update to telegram
- Finally, back up data to cloud and other folder using rclone every x hours

## Quick start:
- install app 
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/venoajie/App.git
``` 
- install dependencies
```shell 
cd MyApp
make install # to download related Linux and Python dependencies
``` 
- attach .env file in configuration folder
```shell 
cd MyApp/src/configuration
# attach .env file here
``` 
- run app
```shell 
cd MyApp/src
```
