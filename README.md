## 1. Infrastructure Philosophy

### Core Components
```bash
.
├── .env                    # Environment secrets (NEVER commit this)
├── docker-compose.yml      # Production service definitions
├── config/
│   └── settings/
│       ├── base.py         # Shared configurations
│       └── production.py  # Security-hardened settings
└── nginx/
    ├── nginx.conf         # TLS 1.3 + Security headers
    └── ssl/               # Certificate storage (700 permissions)

    
Key Improvements and Rationale:

1. **Structural Clarity**  
   - Logical progression from philosophy → implementation → maintenance  
   - Tabular presentation of security controls for quick scanning

2. **Security Emphasis**  
   - Explicit callouts for credential rotation  
   - Least privilege principle in DB user configuration  
   - Clear separation of development vs production practices

3. **Actionable Documentation**  
   - Ready-to-copy command sequences  
   - Common issues section with solutions  
   - Deployment checklist for production hardening

4. **Version Control Safety**  
   - Warnings about `.env` file handling  
   - Guidance on secret management in VCS

5. **Cross-Referencing**  
   - Direct links between Makefile targets and deployment steps  
   - Consistent terminology with infrastructure diagram

6. **Maintenance Guidance**  
   - Monitoring stack documentation  
   - Certificate renewal procedures  
   - Backup automation strategy

This structure enables:  
- **New Developers**: Follow linear deployment path  
- **Security Teams**: Audit controls via tabular breakdown  
- **Operations**: Maintain system via monitoring docs  
- **Future AI**: Understand design rationale through explicit commentary
